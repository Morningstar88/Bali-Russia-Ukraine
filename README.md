# Bali-Russia-Ukraine
Ideas for a difficult situation...

The current situation in Bali with Russians and Ukrainians is somewhat difficult.

- I support a crackdown on rich Muscovites buying up rice fields, and building cafes to avoid the war.

- I do not think a Ukrainian woman working as a hairdresser is going to plunge the Balinese, Indonesian, or SE Asian economy into chaos. 

- 

- Can we brainstorm some solutions?


- I have been on the hard end of Indonesian mercenary-hospitality myself... it is an unsettling experience. 

- It is very, very common for South East Asians to guilt trip, or play the pity card to new tourists to get easy cash. Guilt tripping the Naive Bule is a national sport, and a very 
lucrative source of income. In Macau, in 2009, an East Timorese told me... "Brother, I need miiiieeelk for my son", and promptly went and spent the money at the casino. I knew a glutton in Taipei, who would
go to church, to get donations from gullible Christians. He would then spend the money on pork chops, to fill his already ample waistline. 

- Now, when the chips are down for two countries on the other side of the world, South East Asians, who are quick to play the guilt card to make some cash, are utterly indifferent to the suffering of others. 

- I doubt anyone who has spent significant time in Indonesia is surprised. 

- Because of the situation, the governments of Bali and Indonesia are being given a chance to walk their "religious", "spiritual" talk in real time. Unsurprisingly, they are failing, and proving what many long term foreigners in Indonesia have said quielty amongst ourselves for a long time: "When the money runs out, the smiles stop."

Many of us figure this out after a few months, and take it as a necessary evil on an incredibly beautiful island. Gradually, we decide to hang out with each other. Then the locals act surprised and confused that we are in a "foreigner bubble".

## Go After the Real Culprits

Since at least 2010, the Indonesian and Balinese governments have turned, a blind eye to large scale environmental destruction at the hands of rich, selfish trustafarians. They are either too weak, too indifferent, or too corrupt to put a stop to the slew of
It will take 100 years to fix Sanur. Penestanan has been half destroyed by the rich foreigner build-a-cafe crowd. The governers of Bali have watched this happen in real time, and done nothing. 

Now we are being told that Ukrainian hairdressers are the source of Bali's woes, and if we deport them, the island will revert to a bucolic paradise again.

- The disproportianate response from both the Hindu  

Do the hotshot Balinese immigration department have the guts or fortitude to confront, or deport, the foreigners of all cultures who have taken part in the systematic destruction of Bali's spirit in Ubud, Sanur, Penestanan, Kuta and beyond?

No, he they not.

But, like any populist administration, he can rage and bully against a minority, and look like a tough guy.
